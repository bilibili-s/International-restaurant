    <strong>CANTONESE SPRING ROLLS</strong> <br>
      Not to be confused with egg rolls, Cantonese spring rolls are known worldwide as the perfect side dish, and it makes sense why. Although initially used as a seasonal snack at Chinese New Year festivals, these rolls are eaten all year round and are filled with veggies, cabbage, and other meat fillings.

      <strong>WONTON SOUP</strong> <br>
    For a Northern Chinese dish, you have to try Wonton Soup. The dish is a dumpling type that’s draped in egg yolk wrappings. It’s covered, as most soups are, and thrown together with meats or seafood filling. Wontons are either fried or steamed, by the soup is much better paired with steamed wontons that are submerged in boiled chicken broth.

        <strong>CHAR SUI</strong><br>
        Char Siu is very popular for barbeque enthusiasts since it’s a Cantonese-styled barbeque pork that is tasty on levels that are hard to explain. It’s usually cooked in five-spiced powder, red yeast, and honey. The preferred cooking method is fire-roasted, which allows it to stay sweet and savory for those interested.
